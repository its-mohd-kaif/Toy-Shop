            Toy Box formerly (An Establishment of Narain Das & sons) the
            multi-faceted honeycomb housing the food court, Sweet shop and
            hotel, all under one roof. A name that has been enjoying a pristine
            image for nearly 2 centuries now. Since its inception in 1825, we
            worked hard to offer our clientele best quality products wrapped. We
            focus on hygiene and proper care of all product quality. Thus… today
            we possess the reputation of being one of the leading firms in this
            trade. From a traditional shop in Aminabad, we expanded into a
            modern ambience in the heart of the city, ever maintaining the
            original taste, superior quality and utmost standards of hygiene and
            freshness. Down the years, we have not just conserved the essence of
            traditional sweets, but have also catered to the changing taste of
            modern times-adding that ‘dash of innovation’ to conventional
            merrymaking. Enjoying a top-notch clientele…today, we are privileged
            to be recognized far and wide. Because you are the inspiration…we
            owe it too totally!
